Found a library that contains all the other tools inside it. 
The link to github
https://github.com/broadinstitute/CTAT-VirusIntegrationFinder/wiki/VIF_InstallationInstructions 

1) Prepares pair end samples in the working directory 
~/HNSCC/RNASeq/
|--KBD2/
  |--KBD2_R1.fastq
  |--KBD2_R2.fastq
  ....
  

2) Download singularity image (I have stored it in a dir with all images)
>singularity pull ctat_virusfinder docker://rinityctat/ctat_vif:1.5.0-predev

3) Download genome lib.
There is some kind of compatitbility with the star aligner. Checked in the image the version and it corresponded to the latest STAR version (the topmost) and selected the plug-n-play. I assume this contains all indexes required for the tool to run.

(There is an md5sum file but I have no idea what this is for so i just ignored it. Seems a pretty smart decision atm)
I have unziped it with:
>tar xvzf GRCh37_gencode_v19_CTAT_lib_Mar012021.plug-n-play.tar.gz
and just removed the extra dir to have the ctat_genome_lib_build_dir/ directly in the RNAseq dir


4) Prepare VIF dir with viral genome and index.
There is human viral genomes fasta file available with details on how they generated it.
Instructions:
https://github.com/broadinstitute/CTAT-VirusIntegrationFinder/wiki/Human-Virus-Database-Prep
FASTA:
https://data.broadinstitute.org/Trinity/CTAT_RESOURCE_LIB/VIRUS_INSERTION_FINDING_LIB_SUPPLEMENT/virus_db.nr.fasta 
Downloaded the fasta file and stored in the RNAseq/ dir
To use the fasta file for creating indexes a python script was used that was provided in the singularity image. The instructions do not clearly explain how to get to the script but with some digging i found that it is possible to get to the "bin" in the singularity image. Which makes sense, since I am in the console of the OS from the singularity. 
This is the path for libs:
>/usr/local/bin/

I have generated the viral indexes wiht the main script for the first sample. (It was pretty fast) so I will just remove it for other samples.
>/usr/local/bin/prep_genome_lib/ctat-vif-lib-integration.py \
    --virus_db virus_db.nr.fasta \
    --genome_lib_dir ctat_genome_lib_build_dir \
    --CPU 4


And the full first script
>#!/bin/bash

/usr/local/bin/prep_genome_lib/ctat-vif-lib-integration.py \
    --virus_db virus_db.nr.fasta \
    --genome_lib_dir ctat_genome_lib_build_dir \
    --CPU 4

ctat-vif --left /KBD2/KBD2_R1.fastq \
        --right /KBD2/KBD2_R2.fastq \
        --sample_id KBD2 \
        -O KBD2_ctat \
        --genome_lib_dir ctat_genome_lib_build_dir
        
        
And the job submission script:
>#!/bin/bash

#$ -N virus_finder
#$ -cwd
#$ -m bae


singularity run /home/kprskalo/images/ctat_virusfinder "/home/kprskalo/HNSCC/RNAseq/ctat.sh"

- I should probably modifiy it to allocate CPUs. I think it is using 4 CPUs atm.
