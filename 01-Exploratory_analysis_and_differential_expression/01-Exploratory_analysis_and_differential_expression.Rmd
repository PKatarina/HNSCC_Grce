# Description

This notebook contains analysis of mRNA, microRNA and DNAm data. mRNA
data is previously unpublished, although MiR and DNAm data is:  
MiR:
<https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30783190/>  
DNAm:
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7554960/>  
This is the first notebook that generates results required for further analysis so
it should be ran first. The information about libraries and versions
used while writing this notebook are provided in the bottom via
sessionInfo() function.\
The aim in this project is to make an multi-omics integrative analysis
of HNSC tumor samples. High-throughput sequencing of mRNA and microRNA
was preformed. Exploratory data analysis and differential expression
analysis was preformed according to the DESeq2 vignette. DNAm data was
generated Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC BeadChip that contains
\~900k CpG's.

# mRNA

In this chapter Data analysis of mRNA data is preformed.

### Raw data

Raw data was provided by Sabol and dowloaded from cloud:\
<https://irbhr-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/ivan_sabol_irb_hr/Eq5MRE0xi8pNuNOuwWQ-vb0BT6MaSxwmp97PKUF97YRoxg?e=gA69Fb>\
Data demultiplexing was preformed with script:
???
Building index with: For RNA seq mapping index is built from the gencode
transcirpt data from hg19 assembly:
<https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_19.html> The bash call for
salmon to build the index is this:
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
    salmon index -t gencode.v19.pc_transcripts.fa.gz -i homosapiens_hg19_gencode_transcripts
```
Mapping with Salmon. Mapping was done on a cluster with salmon tool. the
Folder has to contain folder with data (mRNA_data) and the index file
that was built. Data is saved in individual folders that are named
OV401, OV402, ... OV413.
```{bash, eval=FALSE}
    for fn in mRNA_data/OV{401..413};
    do
    samp=`basename ${fn}`
    echo "Processing sample ${samp}"
    salmon quant -i homosapiens_hg19_gencode_transcripts -l A -p 6 --validateMappings --gcBias --numGibbsSamples 20 -o quants/${samp}_quant -1 ${fn}/${samp}_1.fastq.gz -2 ${fn}/${samp}_2.fastq.gz
    done 
```




### Loading data

```{r mRNA loading data}
#reading coldata 
dir <- file.path(getwd(), "data")
mRNA_coldata <- 
  read.csv(file.path(dir, "SampleLIST_mRNA_Grce_15.10.2018.csv"),
           row.names=1, sep=",", 
           stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

#adding file path of quants for tximport
mRNA_coldata$files <- 
  file.path(dir,
            "mRNA_quants_hg19",
            paste0(mRNA_coldata$BASESPACE.NAME,"_quant"),
            "quant.sf")

#Check if everything is okay
file.exists(mRNA_coldata$files)
```

**Tximport**\
This function maps transcript id's to gene id's. Firstly we make an txdb
object from the gff3 file. Then build an tx2gene object which contains
ensembl gene ids and txids from salmon. After tx2gene object is built we
input it in the tximport function. Next we can build an DESeq object
wiht DESeqDataSetFromTximport function. gff3 file -
<https://www.gencodegenes.org/human/release_19.html>
```{bash, eval=FALSE  }
wget -P data https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_19/gencode.v19.annotation.gff3.gz
```


```{r txdb long time, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
#fetching database for mapping gene id to transcript name
txdb <- makeTxDbFromGFF(file.path(dir, "gencode.v19.annotation.gff3.gz"))

k <- keys(txdb, keytype = "TXNAME")
tx2gene <- AnnotationDbi::select(txdb,k,"GENEID", "TXNAME")

saveRDS(tx2gene, file = file.path(getwd(), "outputs/RDS/tx2gene.rds"))
```

Separating these two chunks to make the code faster

```{r tximport, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
tx2gene <- readRDS(file.path(getwd(), "outputs/RDS/tx2gene.rds"))

#parsing txnames
tx2gene$TXNAME <- str_split(tx2gene$TXNAME,pattern = "\\.",
                            simplify =T)[,1]


# importing quantification data
txi <- tximport(mRNA_coldata$files,
                type="salmon", 
                tx2gene=tx2gene,
                ignoreTxVersion=T,
                ignoreAfterBar=T)

```

**Building dds object**\
dds (DeseqDataSet) objects are custom DESeq class of
SummarizedExperiments class from Bioconductor. dds object contains all information about the transcriptome. Counts, sample annotation data,...  
Filtering out low count genes.
```{r mRNA dds, message=FALSE}
# building mRNA dds object
mRNA_dds <- 
  DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi, mRNA_coldata, design= ~ Hist + Tissue + HPV)

# trimming rownames to remove the suffix
rownames(mRNA_dds) <- str_split(rownames(mRNA_dds),"\\.", simplify = T)[,1]

# adding colnames
colnames(mRNA_dds) <- mRNA_coldata$GRCE.NAME

# filtering rows low counts
keep <- rowSums(counts(mRNA_dds)) > 10
mRNA_dds <- mRNA_dds[keep,]

dim(mRNA_dds)
```
Counts data:
```{r mRNA dds coutns}
head(counts(mRNA_dds))
```

### Exploratory analysis

For exploratory analysis as PCA plot and sample distance first preform variance stabilization. Number of samples is low (< 30) function for transforming data is rlog as suggested in the DESeq vignette. 
```{r mRNA rlog transformation, message=FALSE}
mRNA_rld <- DESeq2::rlog(mRNA_dds)
```

**PCA plot**  
PCA plot converts the correlations (or lack there of) among all of the samples into a 2-D graph. Highly correlated samples cluster together. It is a version of a dimension reduction method. Also, the axis are ordered by importanc or how much of the variance in the data they represent. 
```{r mRNA PCA plot}
# selecting data for plotting pca
mRNA_pcadata <- 
  DESeq2::plotPCA(mRNA_rld, 
                  intgroup = c("Hist", "HPV", "Tissue"),
                  returnData = TRUE)
# selecting variance
percentVar <- round(100 * attr(mRNA_pcadata, "percentVar"))


# plotting pca data
ggplot(mRNA_pcadata, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = as.character(HPV), shape = Hist)) +
  geom_point(size =3) +
  xlab(paste0("PC1: ", percentVar[1], "% variance")) +
  ylab(paste0("PC2: ", percentVar[2], "% variance")) +
   theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
         panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"), 
  panel.border = element_rect(fill = "transparent"))+
  coord_fixed() +
  ggtitle("PCA with rlog data")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick1","forestgreen","blue1"))+
  #geom_text_repel(aes(label = colData(mRNA_rld)$Sample.ID), size =3)
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = colData(mRNA_rld)$GRCE.NAME), size =3)

```

**Sample distance**  
To asses overall similarity between samples we
calculate sample distance using the R function dist to calculate the
Euclidean distance.

Triangle sample distance heatmap

```{r mRNA sample distance heatmap-triangle, message=FALSE}
mRNA_annot_row <- as.data.frame(colData(mRNA_rld)[,c("Hist","Tissue", "HPV")])

# Calling the local funciton
## 06.07. - nista to jer sam izgubila funkciju
# triangleHeatMap(assay(mRNA_rld),
#                 annot_row = mRNA_annot_row,
#                 triangle.diagonal=F)


```

### Differential expression analysis

The call to DESeq function preforms the estimation of size factors,
estimation of dispersion values and fits a generalized linear model.
```{r mRNA Running the DESeq function, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mRNA_dds <- DESeq(mRNA_dds, betaPrior = TRUE)
```
```{r, eval=FALSE}
saveRDS(mRNA_dds, file = "outputs/RDS/mRNA_dds.rds")
```

Differential expression on cancer control group
```{r mRNA DE cancer-control}
mRNA_res <- results(mRNA_dds, 
                    contrast = c("Hist","cancer","control"),
                    cooksCutoff = TRUE)

mRNA_res
```

Some summary statistic
```{r mRNA summary stat}
summary(mRNA_res, alpha=0.05)
```

```{r significantly DE mRNA}
mRNA_DE <- dplyr::filter(as.data.frame(mRNA_res), padj < 0.05)

summary(mRNA_DE)
hist(mRNA_DE$log2FoldChange, border="white", col="darkgreen", breaks = 50)
hist(log(mRNA_DE$baseMean), border="white", col="darkblue", breaks = 50)
```

**GSEA on DE mRNA**  
In the next chunk gene set enrichment analysis is preformed on DE mRNA data.  
Most of the significant terms appear to be about muscle contraction. Other terms that appear are signaling, cell-cell communication, immune system processes
```{r gsea on DE mRNA}
# Using only part of sources
GSEA_SOURCES <- c("GO:BP","CORUM","KEGG","REAC","WP","MIRNA", "TF")


# Call on the gost 
gost_mRNA <- 
  gost(rownames(mRNA_DE),
       organism= "hsapiens",
       exclude_iea=TRUE,
       domain_scope="annotated",
       ordered_query=F,
       sources=GSEA_SOURCES)

# Change query name
gost_mRNA$result$query <- "DE genes vs genome"

#Plot and table of significant results
gostplot(gost_mRNA ,capped = F, interactive = T)

publish_gostplot(gostplot(gost_mRNA ,capped = F, interactive = F),
                 highlight_terms = read.csv("GSEA_terms.txt", 
                                            header = F)[,1],
                 filename = "outputs/gost_plot_mRNA_highlighted.png")
```

DE genes on background. Results are similar, which leads to conclude
that all sequenced data is covering most of the genes.
```{r gsea mRNA DE on custom bg}
# Call on the gost 
gost_mRNA <- 
  gost(rownames(mRNA_DE),
       organism= "hsapiens",
       exclude_iea=TRUE,
       domain_scope="custom",
       custom_bg=rownames(mRNA_res),
       ordered_query=F,
       sources=GSEA_SOURCES)

# Change query name
gost_mRNA$result$query <- "DE genes vs sequenced genes"

#Plot and table of significant results
gostplot(gost_mRNA ,capped = F, interactive = T)
```

**HPV effect on cancer**  
In the next chunk explores the effect of HPV on
cancer. To be more precise, it explores which genes are DE in HPV in
cancer. Firstly compare HPV - and controls to get a list of genes that
re DE in cancer samples. Secondly, compare HPV + and HPV - samples and
exclude genes from the previous comparison.
```{r mRNA HPV effect on cancer, message=FALSE}
# making another dds object with different design
mRNA_dds_HPV <- mRNA_dds

# New column in colData for design
colData(mRNA_dds_HPV)$HistHPV <-
  as.factor(paste0(colData(mRNA_dds_HPV)$Hist,colData(mRNA_dds_HPV)$HPV))

# setting the HistHPV des
design(mRNA_dds_HPV) =~ HistHPV

# Running the DESeq function
mRNA_dds_HPV <- DESeq(mRNA_dds_HPV, betaPrior = T)

# Contrasting between negative HPV and controls
res.cN.nN <- 
  #results(mRNA_dds_HPV, contrast=c("HistHPV","cancerN","normalN"), tidy = T)
  results(mRNA_dds_HPV, contrast=c("HistHPV","cancer0","control0"), tidy = T)
# Contrasting between HPV negative and positive
res.cP.cN <- 
  #results(mRNA_dds_HPV, contrast=c("HistHPV","cancerP","cancerN"), tidy = T)
  results(mRNA_dds_HPV, 
          contrast=c("HistHPV","cancer1","cancer0"),
          tidy = F)

summary(res.cP.cN)

res.cP.cN <- 
  #results(mRNA_dds_HPV, contrast=c("HistHPV","cancerP","cancerN"), tidy = T)
  results(mRNA_dds_HPV, contrast=c("HistHPV","cancer1","cancer0"), tidy = T)

# selecting significant results
res.cP.cN <- dplyr::filter(res.cP.cN, padj < 0.1)
res.cN.nN <- dplyr::filter(res.cN.nN, padj < 0.1)

#  
mRNA_res_HPV <- res.cP.cN[!is.element(res.cP.cN$row, res.cN.nN$row),]
mRNA_res_HPV$symbol <- idMap(mRNA_res_HPV$row, genes_dir)

head(mRNA_res_HPV)

```

**GSEA on HPV effect**  
Gene set analysis on HPV related DE mRNA. Showing also non significant results.

gost_HPV <- 
  gost(mRNA_res_HPV$row,
       organism= "hsapiens",
       exclude_iea=FALSE,
       ordered_query=F,
       significant=F,
       sources=GSEA_SOURCES)

# Change query name
gost_HPV$result$query <- "DE HPV related genes vs genome"

#Plot and table of significant results
gostplot(gost_HPV, capped = F, interactive = T)

```

**Volcano plot**

```{r mRNA volcano plot}
volcano <- mRNA_res
LFC.TRESH <- 1
PVAL.TRESH <- 0.05

# Building volcano plot
volcano <- as.data.frame(mRNA_res) %>% 
  dplyr::filter(!is.na(padj)) %>% #filtering NA's
  dplyr::mutate(diffexpressed = dplyr::case_when(
    padj < PVAL.TRESH & log2FoldChange > LFC.TRESH ~ "UP",
    padj < PVAL.TRESH & log2FoldChange < -LFC.TRESH ~ "DOWN",
    TRUE ~ "NO")) 

# Getting hgnc symbols for plotting
volcano$hgnc_symbol <- idMap(rownames(volcano), genes_dir )


# Volcano colors
volcano_cols <- c("red", "gray60", "green")

# p value tresh for delabeling
p_volcano_tresh <- arrange(volcano,padj)[12, "padj"]

volcano <- volcano %>%
  mutate(delabel = ifelse(padj <= p_volcano_tresh,
                          hgnc_symbol,
                          NA))
  

ggplot(data=as.data.frame(volcano), 
       aes(x=log2FoldChange, 
           y=-log10(padj), 
           col=diffexpressed))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_color_manual(values = volcano_cols)

ggplot(data=as.data.frame(volcano), 
       aes(x=log2FoldChange, 
           y=-log10(padj), 
           col=diffexpressed))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_color_manual(values = volcano_cols)+
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = delabel), show.legend = FALSE,
                  size =3, max.overlaps = 50)

```

**Counts plot**\
Visualizing counts for genes

```{r mRNA counts plot overexpressed in cancer}
# Using the list of genes that are labeled in volcano plot
genes <- rownames(filter(volcano, !is.na(delabel)))

# Building an object for multiple counts plot
op <- par(mfrow = c(3,4),
          oma = c(2,2,0,0) + 1,
          mar = c(0,0,1,1) + 1.2)
# Plotting
for(gene in genes){
  plotCounts(mRNA_dds, gene = gene, intgroup = c("Hist"),
             returnData = F, pch = 19, main=idMap(gene, genes_dir))
}
par(op)
```

### Raw data

Raw sequencing data was previously analyzed and published. Since it was
approved this notebook will start with a count matrix that was mapped
with smallRNA Basepace application. It was also provided by Sabol and is
located in the cloud linked in the mRNA Raw data section.

### Loading data

The matrix contains only microRNA counts. For input the counts table was
modified. The modification included deleting the second row which
contains the information about the sample group and the column names
were renamed to an unique id (eg. from Grce_17trimmed to RNA3T). Also, a
0 was added for the first column to denote an column for rownames. The
modified file is miR_counts_matrix.txt

```{r mir loading data, message=FALSE}
# count matrix
mir_countdata <- read.csv("data/miR_counts_matrix.csv", row.names=1)

# coldata
mir_coldata <- read.csv("data/miR_sample_table.csv",
                    row.names = 1,
                    sep = ",",
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE) %>%
  dplyr::select(names=ID, Region_tissue = "Tissue", everything()) %>%
  # Creating Hist - cancer/control column 
  dplyr::mutate(Hist = case_when(Tumor == "SCC" ~ "cancer",
                                 Tumor == "normal" ~ "normal")) %>%
  # Creating Tissue that corresponds to OP or O 
  dplyr::mutate(Tissue = case_when(Region == "oropharyngeal" ~ "OP",
                                   Region == "oral" ~ "O")) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(HPV = case_when(HPV == 1 ~ "P",
                                HPV == 0 ~ "N"))


# Renaming colnames by samle names 
colnames(mir_countdata) <- mir_coldata$names
```

**Excluding samples**\
Here we exclude samples with sampleID KBD9 and KBD25 since they are
outliers as per paper BoÅ¾inoviÄ‡ et al.
```{r miR excluding samples}
keep <- mir_coldata$names != "KBD9" & mir_coldata$names != "KBD25"
mir_coldata <- mir_coldata [keep,]


keep <- colnames(mir_countdata) != "KBD9" & colnames(mir_countdata) != "KBD25"
mir_countdata <- mir_countdata [,keep]

```

**Creating a dds object** The aim of this experiment is to explore
differentially expressed microRNA genes. From this data we can explore
difference between cancer and normal, HPV pos and neg samples and
different tissue samples. This notebook demonstrates differential
expression analysis on the design Tissue + HPV.

```{r mir dds object, message=FALSE}
mir_dds <- DESeqDataSetFromMatrix(countData = mir_countdata, 
                                       colData = mir_coldata, 
                                       design = ~Hist + Tissue + HPV)
  

# filtering low count rows
print("Before low count filtering")
dim(mir_dds)
keep <- rowSums(counts(mir_dds)) > 10
mir_dds <- mir_dds[keep,]
print("After low count filtering")
dim(mir_dds)
```

### Exploratory analysis

Variance transformation is a statistical method for multidimensional
data so it becomes homoskedastic. This data can be analyzed through
clustering and principal component analysis.\
**rlog transformation**  
Regularized logartihm (rlog) transformation
behaves similarly to the log2 transformation. It is slower than the VST
but recomended for small datasets (n\<30).
```{r mir rlog transformation}
mir_rld <- DESeq2::rlog(mir_dds)
```

**Sample distance** To asses overall similarity between samples we
calculate sample distance using the R function dist to calculate the
Euclidean distance.


Triangle sample distance heatmap

```{r mir sample distance heatmap-triangle, eval=FALSE}
mir_annot_row <- as.data.frame(colData(mir_rld)[,c("Hist","Tissue", "HPV")])

triangleHeatMap(assay(mir_rld),
                color = "Reds",
                annot_row = mir_annot_row,
                triangle.diagonal = F)
```

```{r mir PCA plot}
# selecting data for plotting pca
mir_pcadata <- 
  DESeq2::plotPCA(mir_rld, 
                  intgroup = c("Hist", "HPV", "Tissue"),
                  returnData = TRUE,
                  ntop=560)
# selecting variance
percentVar <- round(100 * attr(mir_pcadata, "percentVar"))

# plotting pca data
ggplot(mir_pcadata, aes(x = PC1, y = PC2, color = HPV, shape = Hist)) +
  geom_point(size =3) +
  xlab(paste0("PC1: ", percentVar[1], "% variance")) +
  ylab(paste0("PC2: ", percentVar[2], "% variance")) +
   theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
         panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"), 
  panel.border = element_rect(fill = "transparent"))+
  coord_fixed() +
  ggtitle("PCA with rlog data")+
  scale_color_manual(values = c("firebrick1","forestgreen","blue1"))+
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = colData(mir_rld)$names), size =3)

```

### Differential expression analysis

The call to DESeq function preforms the estimation of size factors,
estimation of dispersion values and fits a generalized linear model.

```{r mir Running the DESeq function, cache=FALSE, message=FALSE}
mir_dds <- DESeq(mir_dds, 
                 betaPrior = T)
```

Differential expression on cancer control group
```{r mir DE cancer-control}
mir_res <- results(mir_dds, 
                   contrast = c("Hist","cancer","normal"),
                   cooksCutoff = TRUE)
mir_res
```

Some summary statistic
```{r mir summary stat}
summary(mir_res, alpha=0.05)
```

Filtering BH adjusted pvalue results
```{r mir significantly DE mir}
mir_DE <- filter(as.data.frame(mir_res), padj < 0.05)

summary(mir_DE)
hist(mir_DE$log2FoldChange, border="white", col="darkgreen")
hist(log(mir_DE$baseMean), border="white", col="darkblue")
```

**HPV effect on cancer**\
In the next chunk explores the effect of HPV on cancer. To be more
precise, it explores which genes are DE in HPV in cancer. Firstly
compare HPV - and controls to get a list of genes that re DE in cancer
samples. Secondly, compare HPV + and HPV - samples and exclude genes
from the previous comparison.

# DNAm

### Raw data

Raw DNAm data was previously published in Gasperov paper:
<https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7554960/> Raw data was
preprocessed with Champ tool - normalization and batch effect removal.
For simplicity preprocesed Rdata was loaded in this notebook. Data was
provided from Sabol.

### Loading data

For this analysis only cancer samples that have available microRNA and
mRNA data will be considered. Since there is no methylation data for
control samples of which there are microRNA and mRNA data, other control
samples will be used for all analysis.

Methylation data is saved in an object from the RnBeads class.

```{r DNAm loading data}
load("data/rnb.set_Combat.RData")

# Renaming the rnb set
rnb_set <- rnb.set_Combat
rm(rnb.set_Combat)
```

This methylation dataset contains data about lesions which was not
considered in this research. Lesion samples are removed here.
Furthermore, additional phenotype data is added here. The xlsx table was
downloaded from cloud and is called additional_columns_impute.xlsx and
renamed to DNAm_additional_pheno.xlsx
[https://irbhr-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/r/personal/ivan_sabol_irb_hr/_layouts/15/Doc.aspx?sourcedoc=%7B78038B29-1ABE-4F97-861F-4054B3A80D37%7D&file=additional_columns_impute.xlsx&action=default&mobileredirect=true]

```{r DNAm removing samples}
# Removing lesions that are not included in the analysis
rnb_set <- 
  remove.samples(rnb_set, 
                 samplelist = (pheno(rnb_set)$Sample_group == "Lesion"))

dnam_pheno <-
  read_xlsx("data/DNAm_additional_pheno.xlsx", range = cell_cols("A:M"))

# Filtering out Lesions and renaming HPV values to P and N
dnam_pheno <-
  dnam_pheno %>%
  filter(Sample_group != "Lesion") %>%
  mutate(HPV = ifelse(HPV == 1 , "P", "N")) 

# Adding HPV and other phenotype data
rnb_set <- addPheno(rnb_set, dnam_pheno$HPV, "HPV")
rnb_set <- addPheno(rnb_set, dnam_pheno$Gender, "Gender")
rnb_set <- addPheno(rnb_set, dnam_pheno$AgeGroup, "Age_group")
```

### Exploratory analysis

For DNAm data there are multiple regions that could be taken into
consideration. Some of the standards are CpG sites that evaluate
individual CpG's, promoters (-2000, 500 from TSS), gene (gene body) and
CpG islands (CGI are ranges with higher frequency of CpG's that are
previously annotated and are known).

**PCA plot**  
PCA plots could be generated over multiple regions.
Individual CpG is computationaly expensive to calculate so only PCA on
CGI is preformed

```{r DNAm PCA plot on CpG islands, message=FALSE}
# Preforming dimension reduction on CpG islands
dred_islands <- rnb.execute.dreduction(rnb_set, target ="cpgislands")

# Building dnam_pca_data table for plotting
dnam_pca_data <- as.data.frame(dred_islands$pca$x[,c("PC1","PC2")])

# Additional annotation data
dnam_pca_data <- 
  cbind(dnam_pca_data,
        dplyr::select(as.data.frame(pheno(rnb_set)), 
                      Sample_group, HPV, Gender, Age_group))


ggplot(dnam_pca_data,aes(x=PC1,y=PC2, color=Sample_group, shape = HPV))+
  geom_point(data = dnam_pca_data, size=4)+
  ggtitle("PCA plot - CpG islands")+
  theme(panel.grid = element_blank(), 
        panel.background = element_rect(fill = "white"),
        panel.border = element_rect(fill = "transparent"))+
  geom_text_repel(aes(label = rownames(dnam_pca_data)), size =3)


```

**Sample distance**  
To asses overall similarity between samples we
calculate sample distance using the R function dist to calculate the
Euclidean distance.

Triangle sample distance heatmap

```{r DNAm sample distance heatmap-triangle, message=FALSE}
# dataframe with annotation rows for triangle heatmap
dnam_annot_row <- dplyr::select(as.data.frame(pheno(rnb_set)), 
                                Sample_group, HPV, Gender, Age_group)

# Annotation dfs need to have samples as rownames
rownames(dnam_annot_row) <- pheno(rnb_set)$Sample_ID

# Call the local function
# triangleHeatMap(meth(rnb_set),
#                 color = "Greens",
#                 annot_row = dnam_annot_row,
#                 triangle.diagonal = F)
```

### Differential methylation

Differential methylation can be calculated for specific sites or genomic
regions. Since promoter and gene (gene body) regions are arbitrary
picked ranges, CpG islands regions are used for differential methylation
analysis. To see meaning of each column look at RnBeads vignette. For
most of the analysis mean.mean.diff was taken into consideration because
the value is similar as fold change in sequencing data.
```{r DNAm differential methylation on cpg islands, message=FALSE}
diff_meth <- rnb.execute.computeDiffMeth(rnb_set,
                                         pheno.cols = "Sample_group",
                                         region.types = "cpgislands")


# Diff methylation table for CpG islands
dnam_res <- get.table(diff_meth,
                      get.comparisons(diff_meth)[1],
                      "cpgislands",
                      return.data.frame =T)

# Diff methylation table for CpG sites, used for volcano plot
dnam_res_sites <- get.table(diff_meth,
                      get.comparisons(diff_meth)[1],
                      "sites",
                      return.data.frame =T)


head(dnam_res)
```

```{r}
dnam_normal_samples <- filter(pheno(rnb_set), Sample_group != "Cancer") %>%
  pull(Sample_ID) %>%
  as.vector()
diff_meth_HPV <- 
  rnb.execute.computeDiffMeth(remove.samples(rnb_set, dnam_normal_samples),
                              pheno.cols = "HPV",
                              region.types = "cpgislands")


# Diff methylation table for CpG islands
dnam_res_HPV <- get.table(diff_meth_HPV,
                      get.comparisons(diff_meth_HPV)[1],
                      "cpgislands",
                      return.data.frame =T)

# Diff methylation table for CpG sites, used for volcano plot
dnam_res_sites_HPV <- get.table(diff_meth_HPV,
                      get.comparisons(diff_meth_HPV)[1],
                      "sites",
                      return.data.frame =T)
```


Summary statistic of significant cpg island differential methylation.
```{r DNAm summary on DM}
summary(filter(dnam_res, comb.p.adj.fdr < 0.05))

```

Global DNA hypomethylation was observed in most cancer tissues and
hypermethylation of certain regions. Since hypomethylation happens at
the level of the genome it is hard to pinpoint if there are direct
oncogenic effect or is it a secondary result of malignancy. However ,
DNA hypermethylation on CpG rich locations named CpG islands which may
affect gene transcirption or chromatin structure. Here we explore
influecne of differential methylation of cpg islands in promoter
regions.

Making GRanges for cpg island data then finding overlaps within hg19
promoter regions. Promoter regions are defined as -2000 and +500 bases
from the transcription start site (TSS).
```{r DNAm res cgi with gene information}
# Combining dnam res data with granges data
dnam_res_cgi <- 
  data.frame(dplyr::select(as.data.frame(annotation(rnb_set, "cpgislands")),
                    Chromosome,Start,End,Strand),
             dplyr::select(as.data.frame(dnam_res),
                    log.quot="mean.mean.quot.log2",
                    pvalue="comb.p.val",
                    padj="comb.p.adj.fdr",
                    num.sites))

# Making Granges object
dnam_res_cgi <-
  makeGRangesFromDataFrame(dnam_res_cgi,keep.extra.columns=TRUE)

# Getting promoter ranges with gene names
promoter_ranges <- unlist(rnb.get.annotation(type="promoters", assembly="hg19"),
                          use.names = F) %>%
  plyranges::select(symbol)

# Transfering ensembl genes to a column so that it does not lose in join overlaps
promoter_ranges$ensembl <- names(promoter_ranges)


# Overlaping cgi with promoter of genes
dnam_res_cgi <-
  join_overlap_left(dnam_res_cgi, promoter_ranges)
```

**Volcano plot**  

Volcano plot on differentially methylated cpg islands. Cancer cells manifest  
global hypomethylation of cpg sites, although this effect is visible in our data  
we also observe a high occurence fo hypermethylation on cpg islands. 
```{r DNAm volcano on cpg islands}
LFC.TRESH <- 0
PVAL.TRESH <- 0.05
volcano_cols <- c("green","red",  "gray60")

# volcano data frame
volcano <- data.frame(values(dnam_res_cgi)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(diffexpressed = dplyr::case_when(
    padj < PVAL.TRESH & log.quot > LFC.TRESH ~ "Hypermethylated",
    padj < PVAL.TRESH & log.quot < -LFC.TRESH ~ "Hypomethylated",
    TRUE ~ "Not significant"))

ggplot(data=as.data.frame(volcano), 
       aes(x=log.quot, 
           y=-log10(padj), 
           col=diffexpressed))+
  geom_point()+
  theme_minimal()+
  scale_color_manual(values = volcano_cols)

table(volcano$diffexpressed)
```

Since there are too many points on the volcano plot for differential
methylation on cpg sites a histogram is used to visualize that most of
cpg sites are hypomethylated. CpGs with padj \< 0.05 are used for
construction of histogram
```{r DNAm histogram plot on cpgs}
# Volcano data frame
dnam_res_sites <- 
  dplyr::select(dnam_res_sites, 
         log.quot="mean.quot.log2",
         pvalue="diffmeth.p.val",
         padj="diffmeth.p.adj.fdr") 

hist(dplyr::filter(dnam_res_sites, padj < 0.05)$log.quot, 
     main="Histogram of CpG sites with padj < 0.05",
     xlab="log.quot",
     col="darkgreen",
     border="white")

volcano <- data.frame((dnam_res_sites)) %>%
  dplyr::mutate(diffexpressed = dplyr::case_when(
    padj < PVAL.TRESH & log.quot > LFC.TRESH ~ "Hypermethylated",
    padj < PVAL.TRESH & log.quot < -LFC.TRESH ~ "Hypomethylated",
    TRUE ~ "Not significant"))


volcano$diffexpressed%>% table()
```
